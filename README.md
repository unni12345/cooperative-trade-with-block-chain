# cooperative-trade-with-block-chain
Cooperative trade is very different from the normal trade [1]. Cooperative trade model is entirely decentralized and doesn’t follow hierarchy. The backbone of the model is the trust each of its members put on each other. This trust develops from an immutable set of infor- mation that is acquired from the long run of the business. Blockchain technology, or the Dis - tributed Ledger Technology is the upcoming disruptive technology, which was brought into light by Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper about Bitcoin [2]. This technology provides a cryptographi- cally protected ledger, which is associated with a decentralized network [3]. This technology makes it possible for entities with no trust on each other to get involved in business. This trust comes from the immutability of all the events that is happening with regard to the ledger and the algorithms and methods followed to reach consensus between each of the network members.
